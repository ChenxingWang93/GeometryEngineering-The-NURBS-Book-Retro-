ALGORITHM A8.2
  MakeCornerFilletSurf(C1,C2,C3,Pwij)
    {  /*  Create NURBS corner fillet surface  */
       /*  Input:  C1,C2,C3  */
       /*  Output: Pwij  */
    1.Compute the common radius and center point of the three boundary arcs.
    2.Using translation, rotation and possibly curve reversal(see Chapter6),position and orient the boundary arcs as in Figure 8.18. Note that, in fact, only C2 must actually be positioned and oriented, as only it is required in order to compute the three control points PT
