Knot vector ***t***

Order _k_

Order = polynomial degree + 1

if 

the order is 2,

the degree is 1,

the B-splines &the curve _c_ are (piecewise) linear

if 

the order is 3,

the degree is 2,

the B-splines &the curve _c_ are quadratic. 

Cubic B-splines &curves have 

order 4

degree 3,

  The parameter range of a B-spline curve _c_ is the interval 

    [t_{k},t_{n+1}]

因此，数学上，the curve is a mapping _c_: [t_{k},t_{n+1}] ➝ ℝ^𝒅,

其中 𝒅 是控制点 的欧拉空间维度 Euclidean space dimension of its control points


B-spline 曲线 的完备表示 complete representation of a B-spline curve 还包含 consists of


_dim_: 底层的欧几里得空间 维度，The dimension of the underlying Euclidean space, 1,2,3.. ..


_n_: 顶点数量 The number of vertices (also the number of B-splines)


_k_: B-样条的阶数(Order) degree plus one


_t_: B-样条的结点向量 The knot vector of the B-splines. ***t*** = (t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n+k}).

Figure 2.1: A linear B-spline (order 2) defined by 3 knots.


***P***: B-spline 曲线 控制点.


p_[d,i], 


d = 1,...,_dim_, 


i = 1,...,n.  


e.g. when _dim_ = 3, 


we have ***P*** = (x_{1},y_{1},z_{1},x_{2},y_{2},z_{2},...,x_{n},y_{n},z_{n}).


_c_ 中的阵列 array 开始于 index 0，这意味着，例如，如果


阵列 _t_ holds the knot vector, then t[0] = t_{1},...,t[n+k-1] = t_{t+k}


the parameter interval goes from t[k-1] to t[n] similar considerations apply to the other arrays.


- The knot vector 必须是 非-降序 non- decreasing: t_{i} ⩽ t_{i+1}. Moreover, 两个结点必须区分开 two knots
t_{i} &t_{i+1} must be distinct:t_{i} ⩽ t_{i+1}

- 顶点数 大于等于 曲线阶数 The number of vertices greater than or equal to the order of the curve _n_ ≥ _k_

- _k_ equal knots at beginning &at the end of the knot vector; 结点向量knot vector ***t*** 满足条件 t_{1} = t{2} = ... t_{k} &t_{n+1} = t{n+2} = ... t_{n+k}


The dimension of the curve ***c*** is equal to that of _its control points_ ***p_{i}***
