Knot vector ***t***

Order _k_

Order = polynomial degree + 1

if 

the order is 2,

the degree is 1,

the B-splines &the curve _c_ are (piecewise) linear

if 

the order is 3,

the degree is 2,

the B-splines &the curve _c_ are quadratic. 

Cubic B-splines &curves have 

order 4

degree 3,

  The parameter range of a B-spline curve _c_ is the interval 

    [t_{k},t_{n+1}]

因此，数学上，the curve is a mapping _c_: [t_{k},t_{n+1}] ➝ ℝ^𝒅,

其中 𝒅 是控制点 的欧拉空间维度 Euclidean space dimension of its control points


B-spline 曲线 的完备表示 complete representation of a B-spline curve 还包含 consists of


_dim_: 底层的欧几里得空间 维度，The dimension of the underlying Euclidean space, 1,2,3.. ..


_n_: 顶点数量 The number of vertices (also the number of B-splines)


_k_: B-样条的阶数(Order) degree plus one


_t_: B-样条的结点向量 The knot vector of the B-splines. ***t*** = (t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n+k}).


The dimension of the curve ***c*** is equal to that of _its control points_ ***p_{i}***
