A B-spline curve is defined by the formula

Knot vector ***t***

Order _k_

Order = polynomial degree + 1

if 

the order is 2,

the degree is 1,

the B-splines &the curve _c_ are (piecewise) linear

if 

the order is 3,

the degree is 2,

the B-splines &the curve _c_ are quadratic. 

Cubic B-splines &curves have 

order 4

degree 3,

  The parameter range of a B-spline curve _c_ is the interval 

    [t_{k},t_{n+1}]

因此，数学上，the curve is a mapping _c_: [t_{k},t_{n+1}] ➝ ℝ^𝒅,

其中 𝒅 是控制点 的欧拉空间维度 Euclidean space dimension of its control points

The dimension of the curve ***c*** is equal to that of _its control points_ ***p_{i}***
