##### 2 Most common methods of representing curves and surfaces in geometric modeling 
- implicit equations 隐式方程
  - lying in the 𝑥 & 𝑦 plane has the form ***⨍(𝑥,𝑦) = 0***. this equation describes an implicit relationship between the ***𝑥 &𝑦*** coordinates of the points lying on the curve. (the circle of unit radius centered at the origin)
  
  #### ⨍(𝑥,𝑦) = 𝑥^2 + 𝑦^2 - 1 = 0

  
- parametric functions 参数函数
  - each of the coordinates of a point on the curve is represented separately as an explicit function of an independent parameter
  
  #### 𝐶(𝑢) = (𝑥(𝑢),𝑦(𝑢))  𝑎 <= 𝑢 <= 𝑏
