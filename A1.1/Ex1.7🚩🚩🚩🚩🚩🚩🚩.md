shows a sixth-degree, closed Bezier curve.

The curve is smooth at 

𝙲(𝟶) ( = 𝙲(𝟷)) because `P_{𝟷} - P_{𝟶}` is parallel to `P_{𝟼} - P_{𝟻}`

By smooth we mean that the tangent vectors at `𝚞 = 𝟶` &`𝚞 = 𝟷` have the same direction.

In addition to the previously mentioned properties, Bezier curves are invariant under the usual transformations 

such as rotations, translations, and scalings; that is, one applies the transformation to the curve by applying it to the control polygon.

We present this concept more rigorously in Chapter 𝟹 for B-spline curves(of which Bezier curves are a special case).

  In any curve(or surface) representation scheme, the choice of basis functions determines the geometric characteristics of the scheme.
