From Eqs. (1.7)

&(1.8) We have

𝙲(𝚞) = (𝟷 - 𝚞)^2P_{𝟶} + 𝟸𝚞(𝟷 - 𝚞)P_{𝟷} + 𝚞^2P_{𝟸}

1 个 抛物线 a parabolic arc from

```
P_{𝟶}
```

to

```
P_{𝟸}
```

Figure 𝟷.𝟷𝟶

```
the polygon formed by {P_{𝟶},P_{𝟷},P_{𝟸}}
```

called the control polygon, approximates the shape of the curve rather nicely;

```
- P_{𝟶} = 𝙲(𝟶) &P_{𝟸} = 𝙲(𝟷)
```

- the tangent directions to the curve at its endpoints are parallel to

```
P_{𝟷} - P_{𝟶}
```

&

```
P_{2} - P_{1}
```
(this is derived later);

the curve is contained in the triangle formed by

P_{𝟶} P_{1} P_{2}
