The Pi = (xi, yi, zi) and Bi,n(u) are as before; the wi are scalars, called the weights, Thus, W(u) = E oBi,n(u)wi is the common denominator function. Except where explicitly stated otherwise, we assume that wi > 0 for all i. This ensures that W(u) > 0 for all u c[0,1]. We

The Ri,n(u) are the rational basis functions for this curve form. Figure 1.18a shows an example of cubic basis functions, and Figure 1.18b a corresponding cubic rational Bezier curve.

  The Ri,n(u) have properties which can be easily derived from Eq.(1.15) and the corresponding properties of the Bi,n(u):

P1.8 nonnegativity: Ri,n(u) > 0 for all i,n and 0<u<1;

P1.9 partition of unity: o Ri,n(u) = 1 for all 0<u<1;

P1.10 Ro,n(0) = Rn,n(1) = 1;

P1.11 Ri,n(u) attains exactly one maximum on the interval [0,1];

P1.12 if wi = 1 for all i, then Ri,n(u)

These yield the following geometric properties of rational Bezier curves:

P1.13 convex hull property: the curves are contained in the convex hulls of their defining control points(the Pi);

P1.14 Transformation invariance: rotations, translations, and scaling are applied to the curve by applying them to the control points;

P1.15 variation diminishing property: same as for polynomial Bezier curves (see previous section);

P1.16 endpoint interpolation: C(0) = Po and C(1) = Pn;

P1.17 the kth derivative at u = 0 (u = 1) depends on the first (last) k + 1 control points and weights; in particular, C'(0) and C'(1) are parallel to P1 - P0 and P. - Pn_li respectively;

P1.18 polynomial Bezier curves are a special case of rational Bezier curves.
