Let us return to the circular arc of Figure [1.19b](https://github.com/ChenxingWang93/GeometryEngineering/blob/main/A1.4/Ex1.12.md)

We have 𝑷_{0} = (1,0), 

𝑷_{1} = (1,1),

𝑷_{2} = (0,1),

𝑤_{0} = 1,

𝑤_{1} = 1,

𝑤_{2} = 2,

Hence, for Eq.[(1.17)](https://github.com/ChenxingWang93/GeometryEngineering/blob/main/A1.4/Ex1.12.md)

the three dimensional control points are

𝑷_{0} = (1,0,1), 

𝑷_{1} = (1,1,1),

𝑷_{2} = (0,2,2).

Then 𝑪''(𝑢)_(1-u)^{2}P_{0} + 2u(1-u)P_{i} + u^{2}PZ is a parabolic arc(nonrational),

which projects onto a circular arc on the 𝑾 = 1 plane (see Figure 1.22)
